kubernetes assignment




**Before start, you need the following:
**
  Kubernetes cluster up and running in a cloud provider.
  Kubectl with access to your cluster.
  Nginx ingress controller: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/ 


**How to use it
**
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldemestico/stackioassignment/main/k8sassignment.yml 
  
**clarifications
**
  It is recommended to separate the yaml file by type to run them.
  Since I didn't have much time, I couldn't make a good readme file or split the yaml.
  I couldn't try it because I can't use my employer group and I don't have time to install one on my computer. But it should work.
